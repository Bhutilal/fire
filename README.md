# fire-zero
fire 8.2 self-play nnue

## tools used:

- fire 8.2 https://github.com/FireFather/fire (engine for generation of self-play games)
- cutechess https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess (command-line application to run self-play games)
- deeds tools https://outskirts.altervista.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2009 (nnue-extract.exe to obtain fen positions and evaluation data from pgn files)
- nnue-gui https://github.com/FireFather/nnue-gui (windows application for nnue training session management)
- sf-nnue https://github.com/FireFather/sf-nnue (optimized port of the original nodchip shogi neural network implementation)
- pgn-extract https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/ (used by nnue-extract to extract fen positions and info from pgns)
- little blitzer http://www.kimiensoftware.com/software/chess/littleblitzer (for testing nnue vs nnue, etc.)
- chessbase 16 64-bit https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/chessbase_16_fritz18_bundle (opening book creation -> remove duplicate games from pgn files)
- 40H-pgn tools http://40hchess.epizy.com/ (truncate.exe opening book ply limitation, & gameSplit.exe to break up pgns to multiple parts)

## instructions to create an efficiently-updatable neural network (nnue) for any engine:
- setting up a suitable Windows environment
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireFather/fire-zero/master/docs/environment.md

- creating an efficient opening book using cutechess-cli
- running selfplay games for a 'zero' nnue approach
- using eval-nnue and/or eval-extract
- position (fen) extraction from pgn files
- conversion to plain text
- conversion of plain text files to nnue .bin training format
- training Ã© command-line management using nnue-gui
- creating an initial nnue
- testing the generated nnues
- improving the NNUE with supervised & reinforcement learning
