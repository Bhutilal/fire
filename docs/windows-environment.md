This is basically a directory w/ cutechess-cli.exe and dlls installed.  It also contans .bat file to lauch cutechess as well as some sub-directories
to hold the generated pgs, training tools, etc.

I recommend mirroring the installation to a networked drive for backup & redundancy. I use a licensed version of Beyond Compare.

The nnue-train directory holds nnue-gui.exe (training management), sf-nnue exectuables (training), and .bat files to organize data  rename nets etc.
