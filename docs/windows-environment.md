This is basically a directory w/ cutechess-cli.exe and dlls installed.  It also contans .bat file to lauch cutechess as well as some sub-directories to hold the generated pgs, training tools, etc.

I recommend mirroring the installation to a networked drive for backup & redundancy. I use a licensed version of Beyond Compare.
